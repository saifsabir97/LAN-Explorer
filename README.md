# LAN-Explorer
This script scans all the devices connected to your LAN for any open ports.

Once the scan is done, it draws an interactive topology graph with open port details for each device.

## **Example 1: For a network with 3 devices connected to the router

The center node will be the router. All connected edges to the center node are connected devices in LAN.
Here, port 80 and 53 are open in the router which can be seen when hovered over the node.
